Multiversal Interfaces
======================

Work in progress.
The plan is to parse header files from the executor project,
convert them to an intermediate (YAML) representation, and then generate
C/C++ header files from them again for use with Retro68.

As Executor was a clean-room implementation of MacOS, the resulting header files will
be freely redistributable.
