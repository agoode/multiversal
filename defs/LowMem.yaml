      Declarations of low memory globals which haven't been put anywhere else
      yet follow. Whenever a low memory global clearly belongs to one manager/module,
      put it should live in the appropriate header.
      There is also a complete list of low memory globals in globals.cpp,
      which is not used but might be nice to have.
